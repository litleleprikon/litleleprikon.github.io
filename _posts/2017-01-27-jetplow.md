Hi there! Today I had a great lecture from [@nezlooy](https://twitter.com/nezlooy) about JETPLOW attack for Cisco hardware firewalls. This lecture is extremely interesting and addictive. I also learned a lot about a booting. Yeah I knew about UEFI/BIOS ways to load OS but during this lecture I realized full way of OS loading in Cisco devices.

During this lecture I also realized that bugs and vulnerabilities are able to live years in different versions of firmware.

So if you want to take new knowledge in this topic look at the slides [https://2016.zeronights.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/jetplow.pdf](https://2016.zeronights.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/jetplow.pdf)
