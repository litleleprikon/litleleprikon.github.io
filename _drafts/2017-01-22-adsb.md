So guys. It's time for technical posts. And as You can see this one is about ADS-B standard. 

What is ADS-B? ADS-S(Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast) is a broadcasting radio technology which allow flights to send different kinds of information to environment. What it means in other words? Every plane which equiped with this techology device sends every second the message about itself. This message contains such data as coordinates, weather information, vertical and horizontal speed of plane and course. This information is very usefull for another planes and ground control. Pilots of planes can easily investigate traffic near it and avoid crashes.

So how to tune all staff and receive signals? First of all you need RTL SDR. RTL SDR is a family of cheap TV-tuners which based on RTL2832 chipset. 

### Sotware installation
So now when we have tuner we need to install software and drivers. First of all we need to install rtl-sdr library. This library requires libusb and wee have to install it. The easiest way is via brew.

```bash
$ brew install libusb
```

Now we can install rtl-sdr. 

```bash
$ git clone git://git.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr.git
$ cd rtl-sdr/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
```

Here we have installed rtl-sdr lib we can use [Gqrx SDR](http://gqrx.dk/) to scan radio waves around you. You can download Gqrx [here](http://gqrx.dk/download). And then try to find FM radiostations. To do this choose modulation type `FM` and frequencies between 87,5 MHz and 108 MHz.

Ok our radio is working let's install ADS-B software. I used two tools: [dum1090](https://github.com/antirez/dump1090) and [cocoa1090](http://www.blackcatsystems.com/software/cocoa1090.html) which based on previous tool.
