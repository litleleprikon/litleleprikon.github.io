# Welcome to my blog!


Hi there, It's my first time blogging experience and it's little bit scary. So...

Today we started to make lab about SDR. SDR (Software Defined Radio) is a special device that able to sniff radio signals on wide range of frequences. This means that we can listen our environment for different wireles protocols. So I will try to sniff ADS-B signals and define flight airplanes around me.
